Welcome to the Airi Home page! This page is currently under construction, but you can still find links to my Twitter, YouTube, and GitHub pages. 

This page is built with HTML and CSS, and imports fonts from Google Fonts and Online Web Fonts. It also uses Font Awesome for icons. 

The page features a cute hamster running in a wheel for decoration. 

Thank you for visiting!
